This program `arXiv manager` enables you to extract and filter interesting papers from the website arXiv. The [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org/) (pronounced "archive", as if the "X" were the Greek letter *Chi*) is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million article milestone on October 3, 2008, and hit a million by the end of 2014. For more details, see [introduction to arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv). You can find the project in [GitHub](https://github.com/nju-cs-quark/arxiv-manager).
